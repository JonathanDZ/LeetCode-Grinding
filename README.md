# LeetCode-Grinding

## For Future Me

- [Day 1](#day-1)

## Day 1

Setup this repository, and gather a bunch of information about how to start LeetCode in a better way, then combine all the Internet wisdom into my study plan, expecting this plan will be improved during the time.

Thanks to [this awesome tutorial](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/algorithm-design/lesson/77), I made my first version of [LeetCode Grinding Sheet], I should follow this pattern whenever I counter a new coding problem, and that will save my life when actual interview happens.

According to my plan, I'll follow [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) to begin my LeetCode journey, and do only 1 easy per day (except weekend) to build up consistency, the primary goal is just to get used to the platform and solve programming questions everyday.

Tomorrowâ€˜s goal:

- [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- Continue to make the LeetCode Grinding Sheet Template
